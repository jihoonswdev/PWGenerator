Array of special characters
 var specialChar = ['@', '!']

Array of numerical characters 

Array of lowerCase characters (look up .split() )

Array of upperCase characters (look up .split() )
* dont have to split*



********************************* here ********************
Create a function that prompts the user for the password options
    function getUserOptions() {

Create a var to store the length of password from the user input (look up parseInt())
    var passLength = 

Create a conditional statement to check if the length is an actual number
Create a conditional to check if PW length is atleast 8 char long
Create a conditional to check if PW length is lower than 128 chars

Create 4 different conditional statement to store if user password is going to use special char, numbers, lower and upper

Create a conditional statement to check if user included some type of character

Create a variable to store the user input 
create object to store user input

    var passOptions = {
    passLength: passLength,
    specialChars,
    numerialChars,
    lowerCase,
    upperCase
}

return out passOptions

}

// *************************** to here is 1 function *******************

function for getting a random element from an array
****check out math.random

function to generate a password with our user input
    function generatePassword{

create a variable and call our function so we can use data from the previous function.
    var userOptions = getUserOptions();

Create a variable to store password
    var results = []

Array to store the type of characters to include in our password
    var userPosChars = []

Array to contain atleast one of each chosen type of characters to make sure atleast one of every character is being used
 (validation)
    var guarChar = []

Create conditional statements that add the array of character into an array of possible characters based on our users input 
+ need to push our random characters tot he guarenteed characters (look up .concat())

if (userOptions.specialChracters) {
    take chars and concat
    take characters and push(randomizationFunction(specialCharacter)) (AFTER WE RANDOMIZE)
}

Create conditional statements that add the array of character into an array of possible characters based on our users input 
+ need to push our random characters tot he guarenteed characters (look up .concat())

if (userOptions.specialChracters) {
    take chars and concat
    take characters and push(randomizationFunction(specialCharacter)) (AFTER WE RANDOMIZE)
}

if (userOptions.specialChracters) {
    take chars and concat
    take characters and push(randomizationFunction(specialCharacter)) (AFTER WE RANDOMIZE)
}

Create a for loop to pluck out random options objects and grabbing random characters from the array of possible character
and concat them into the results variable

Create another forloop to guarantee atleast one character from each possible character in the results

Take the result (look up join()) and turn it into a string
